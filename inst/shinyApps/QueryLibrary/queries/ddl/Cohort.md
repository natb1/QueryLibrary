# Cohort










 

## Description
The COHORT table contains records of subjects that satisfy a given set of criteria for a duration of time. The definition of the cohort is contained within the COHORT_DEFINITION table. It is listed as part of the RESULTS schema because it is a table that users of the database as well as tools such as ATLAS need to be able to write to. The CDM and Vocabulary tables are all read-only so it is suggested that the COHORT and COHORT_DEFINTION tables are kept in a separate schema to alleviate confusion.
