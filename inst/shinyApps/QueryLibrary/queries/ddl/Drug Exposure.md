# Drug Exposure










 

## Description
This table captures records about the exposure to a Drug ingested or otherwise introduced into the body. A Drug is a biochemical substance formulated in such a way that when administered to a Person it will exert a certain biochemical effect on the metabolism. Drugs include prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or applied locally do not count as Drugs.
### User Guidance
The purpose of records in this table is to indicate an exposure to a certain drug as best as possible. In this context a drug is defined as an active ingredient. Drug Exposures are defined by Concepts from the Drug domain, which form a complex hierarchy. As a result, one DRUG_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID may map to multiple standard concept ids if it is a combination product. Records in this table represent prescriptions written, prescriptions dispensed, and drugs administered by a provider to name a few. The DRUG_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID can be used to find and filter on these types. This table includes additional information about the drug products, the quantity given, and route of administration.
