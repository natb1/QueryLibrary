# Episode Event










 

## Description
The EPISODE_EVENT table connects qualifying clinical events (such as CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, DRUG_EXPOSURE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, MEASUREMENT) to the appropriate EPISODE entry. For example, linking the precise location of the metastasis (cancer modifier in MEASUREMENT) to the disease episode.
### User Guidance
This connecting table is used instead of the FACT_RELATIONSHIP table for linking low-level events to abstracted Episodes.
