# Source To Concept Map










 

## Description
The source to concept map table is a legacy data structure within the OMOP Common Data Model, recommended for use in ETL processes to maintain local source codes which are not available as Concepts in the Standardized Vocabularies, and to establish mappings for each source code into a Standard Concept as target_concept_ids that can be used to populate the Common Data Model tables. The SOURCE_TO_CONCEPT_MAP table is no longer populated with content within the Standardized Vocabularies published to the OMOP community.
